# Pure

A minimal theme for Micro.blog.

This theme was built around a few key ideas:

- HTML should be as semantic and clear as possible.
- The page should be readable without CSS or JavaScript.
- Style should be simplistic.

There is also the desire for this theme to be a good base for other themes. Because of the semantic HTML, it should be relatively easy to modify the CSS to make the theme more personalised.
